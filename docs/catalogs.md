# Catalog contract

The four files under `manifests/catalogs/` are the canonical inventories of
symbols, structs and fields, vtables and slots, and explicit relations. Topic
manifests remain investigation records and are not generated from catalogs or
rewritten when a fact is promoted.

See the [topic manifest contract](topic-manifests.md) for topic-record fields,
current evidence, dependencies, and promotion boundaries.

## Identity and formats

IDs are unique within the current catalogs. Allocate the next four-digit value
for the entity kind: `RVA-SYM-`, `RVA-STR-`, `RVA-FLD-`, `RVA-VTBL-`,
`RVA-SLOT-`, or `RVA-REL-`. The validation gate rejects a repeated ID anywhere
in the four catalogs.

Catalog IDs remain reserved through symbol 0267, struct 0050, field 0158,
vtable 0028, slot 0043, and relation 0373. An established entity keeps its ID.
Allocate a new entity after the applicable reserved maximum. Do not fill an
apparent gap with a different entity.

Guest virtual addresses use exactly `0x` followed by eight uppercase hexadecimal
digits. Struct and slot offsets use `0x` followed by uppercase hexadecimal with
no redundant leading zeroes. Address-derived placeholder names such as
`sub_82267A28` are preferred until evidence supports a semantic name.

Every top-level record references the supported image contract at
`../image.json`. A native address or evidence locator enters a catalog only
after it is verified against that image.

## Evidence and confidence

Each claim has one or more evidence entries. Supported evidence kinds are
`topic-manifest`, `ghidra-static`, `generated-code`, `runtime-probe`, and
`external-reference`. A topic-manifest locator is a catalog-relative JSON file
plus a resolving JSON Pointer, for example
`../runtime-baseline.json#/configuredRoot`. Other locator forms are constrained
by the catalog schemas.

Confidence is exactly `confirmed`, `strong`, `candidate`, or `rejected`.
`confirmed` requires authoritative static identity or runtime corroboration for
a behavioral claim. `strong` has direct evidence with a remaining boundary.
`candidate` is a bounded interpretation still needing discrimination.
`rejected` preserves a falsified candidate when retaining it prevents repeated
work. Every claim records at least one unresolved alternative or an explicit
falsification condition.

## Relations

Relations are asserted records, never generated from names, address proximity,
or matching shapes. Both endpoints must be existing symbol, struct, field,
vtable, or slot IDs. A relation is added only when its own evidence states that
edge. Evidence for the endpoint records alone is insufficient.

`tools\verify.ps1` loads all four schemas, checks repository-wide IDs and
endpoints, resolves topic-manifest evidence, and runs focused negative tests.
