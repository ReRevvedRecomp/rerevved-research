# Recovered game reference

These pages present settled guest-code findings by game system. They are the
readable layer over the topic manifests and reusable catalogs, not a separate
source of evidence.

- [Unit definitions](unit-definitions.md) - unit type IDs, base combat stats,
  and shared combat and AI consumers.
- [Civilization bonuses](civilization-bonuses.md) - leaders, player-facing
  bonus effects, the 16 by 4 cumulative era-bonus table, and its shared
  activation lookup.
- [Save storage and slot identity](save-storage.md) - selected record layout,
  internal filenames, and pre-load/post-save sidecar edges.

Keep related strings, semantic function names, enum values, fields, and guards
together on the applicable system page. Do not create separate string,
function, or enum inventories here. The machine-readable catalogs provide the
canonical cross-system indexes.
